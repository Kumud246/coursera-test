			<P>HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is like a skeleton of the website. It creates the structure. Like which division of the website should be placed where. It uses tags to define the structure. Every other language used to develop website is linked inside HTML. HTML is for adding meaning to raw content by marking it up.</P>

		<p>Cascading Style Sheets acts like makeup for the HTML. CSS improves the colors and layout of a website structure built with HTML. CSS is used to style these HTML content to make the web page more visually appealing. Eg. SelectedTag{property: value}. CSS is for formatting that marked up content.</p>

			<p>Javascript is like the nature of the website. How you want that website to work could be defined by javascript. For example on taking the mouse over the button I want a drop down list to appear from it or I want to change the background color of website on clicking that button etc. JavaScript is for making that content and formatting interactive.</p>
